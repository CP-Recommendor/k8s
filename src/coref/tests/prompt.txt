I am writing a model to verify co-reference resolution for a conversation between a chatbot  that helps farmers in Odisha India. The format of input is something like below.

Input
Q: What is the best month to sow paddy?
A: ...
Q: Which schemes can I leverage for it?

Output
Q: What is the best month to sow paddy?
A: ...
Q: Which schemes can I leverage for paddy?

You can see that "paddy" was resolved and updated instead of it. Feel free to choose any answer (A) coming from the AI bot. There could be co-reference resolutions from that as well.

The co-reference resolution should also be in the same format. You are free to choose anywhere between 1 and 3 questions for samples and always terminates at a Question (Q).

Can you share 20 +ve examples of it?
